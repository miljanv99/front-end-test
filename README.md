## Test requirements

### Style

- Please follow the design instructions found [here](https://share.goabstract.com/bed3c646-b615-4548-8a1c-adeb861473c8)
- Create variables and mixins files
- Try to use scss functions where needed
- Use of Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Use of Angular Material for components (optional)

### Logic

- ES6 syntax is preferable
- Don’t repeat yourself (try not to repeat same code more than twice)
- Nice to have: redux
